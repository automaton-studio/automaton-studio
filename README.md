## Technical Details

The solution consists of:
- A Desktop application used mostly to design, debug and test flows locally
- A Web application used mostly to design and orchestrate flows
- A Runner application to execute flows on other computers

Automaton Studio is written in C# / Blazor, and it relays on a few other opensource projects.
